# Yankun's Express Guide

**Express** is a framework for creating web servers using Node. Express helps you **process incoming requests** and **create responses** in the HTTP request/response cycle. To understand how to use it, it is critical in understanding what is a framework.

## Framework vs Library

* *library* - code other people wrote that you can use in your application, where you have control over how to use them
* *framework* - also code that other people wrote, but there is **inversion of control**, where you don't have control over how to use the code but rather, you have to *follow the rules* of the framework

Note: you are trading freedom for speed and efficiency when you use a framework.
